# useTabulus

The `useTabulus` hook allows for you to generate the internal properties and methods of Tabulus to use with your own components.

It accepts the same props that the `Tabulus` component does, with the exception of the `components` prop (which defines custom components to use) as it does none of the actual table generation itself - it provides you with the tools to do that!

## Usage

```ts
const methods = useTabulus(props);
```

## Props

## Returns

`useTabulus` returns an object containing the following methods/properties. You can destructure the return value to extract just those you need, or you can use it as is.
The return value can be spread into the `<TabulusContextProvider>` provider to pass all of these values down the tree to child components.

```ts
interface UseTabulusReturn {
  /** Registers the table with a `TabulusRegistry` Context. */
  registerTable: (tableId: string, ref: TableRef)
}
```
