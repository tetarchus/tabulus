title: Table Creation
---

## Overview

This page will outline the various options for creating tables with `tabulus`.

## 1. The `<Tabulus />` Component

This is the simplest method for creating a table, and ensures that all of the functionality works as
expected.

## 2. The `<Tabulus />` Component - With custom components

While using `<Tabulus />` is normally enough for most users, we recognise that in some cases the
default components will not offer the exact options that you require (even with all of the powerful
[options](@todo) available). In this case you're able to override almost every component in the
table with a custom component that works exactly how you need it to.

The downside to this is that the default components are deeply embedded with the logic required to
implement every aspect of `tabulus`, so if you override them, you may need to implement some of this
yourself (a lot of the logic will still be passed down, but you'll need to use/call it when needed).

For more information on requirements for custom components, please see the
[custom components](@todo) documentation.

## 3. The `useTabulus` Hook

Need a completely custom set of components without any of the wrappers getting in the way and want
to choose exactly how you use the table logic?

The [`useTabulus`](@todo) hook takes the same input as the `Tabulus` component (except for custom
components), and returns a set of functions that `Tabulus` uses internally to manage and render the
data into a table. You can then use and manipulate as needed in order to create a completely custom
experience.

You can also pass _all_ of the output of `useTabulus` directly into a
[`TabulusContextProvider`](@todo) to make this data available to components within the context
without having to manually pass it down the tree.
