title: Tabulus Registry
---

## Overview

The `TabulusRegistry` context allows for central management of your tables. It's not required to use
`tabulus`, however certain functionality, detailed below, will not work without it.

## Features

## Creating the Registry

The `TabulusRegistry` context should wrap your application code. Any table created within this
context (via any of the [creation methods](@todo)) will automatically register themselves with the
registry if present.

@todo - Example here

## Usage

You can access the registry by using the [`useTabulusRegistry`](@todo) hook. This allows you to use
certain functions to manipulate the tables contained within the registry, without needing to be
within the table's tree itself.

For more information on the functions exposed by the `useTabulusRegistry` hook, please see it's
[documentation](@todo).
