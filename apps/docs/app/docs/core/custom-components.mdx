title: Tabulus Registry

While using the `<Tabulus />` component is the simplest method for creating a table, `tabulus` also
allows for using custom components - either passed in as options for `<Tabulus />` to render
internally, or when using the [`useTabulus`](../hooks/use-tabulus.mdx) hook to generate your own
markup.

When using custom components, it's up to you to implement various features of those components.
