title: Theme | Borders

Border can be controlled using the [`borders`](@todo) property of the [`theme`](@todo).

This allows for control over every aspect of the borders in your table, and largely functions like a
standard [HTML Table](@todo).

## Basic Properties

The [`borders`](@todo) theme property has several top-level keys:

- `all` [required] - Controls all of the borders for table components that do not have their own
  options defined.
- `cell` - Controls all cell borders, including header cells if they do not have their own values
  defined.
- `column` - Controls borders for columns.
- `header` - Controls borders around the header element that contains the header cells.
- `headerCell` - Controls borders for cells in the header.
- `row` - Controls borders around an entire row.
- `table` - Controls the border around the entire table.

## Definitions

Each of the above properties is an object containing a range of properties specific to each
component. If they are not defined, there are fallback values that will be used in their place.

- `borderCollapse`
- `borderColor`
- `borderSides`
- `borderSpacing`
- `borderStyle`
- `borderWidth`

## Common Border Style Recipes

For the most part, the simple `borderSides` values can be used to control most borders. Here are
some theme options for common table border styles. You can then simply define border
color/style/width where needed if they need to differ.

{/* @todo: Test that these all work as expected */}

- Header and Column (no external or row borders)
- External only (border around the table edge only)
- Internal only (border between each row and column, but nothing around the edge)
- All - Borders around everything
- Header only (a single line below the header row, with no other borders)
