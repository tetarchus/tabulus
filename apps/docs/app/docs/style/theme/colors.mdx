title: Theme | Colors
---

The standard table colors can be defined under the [`colors`](@todo) property of the
[`theme`](@todo).

## Available Color Options

- `backgroundColor`: The main background of the table.
- `borderColor`: The color to use for all table borders. This falls back to the textColor, and is
  overridden by providing colors under the [`borders`](@todo) property of the theme.
- `textColor`: The color to use for text in the table.

@todo: Add these

- `headerTextColor`: The color to use for text in the table header.
- `rowColor`: An array of colors to use for 'striping' rows. The colors will be cycled through in
  order each time, so if 3 colors are provided, every 3 rows will be the same colors.
- `columnColor`: @todo need to think how this can/should work. Allow for 2 axis striping: possibly
  have array of arrays and/or multiple acceptable types for the property.
