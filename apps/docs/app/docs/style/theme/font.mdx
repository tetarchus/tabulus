title: Theme | Fonts

You can control the fonts used in the table with the [`fonts`](@todo) property of the
[`theme`](@todo). Using the options available here, you can control font size, family and weights.

- `fontFamily`: Accepts either a single font-family string for using the same font across the whole
  table, or an object containing `header` and `table` keys with different font-family strings for
  each. If this is not defined, the font will be inherited from the page the table is on.
- `baseSize`: The table can have a separate base size to the rest of the document if required. This
  will set the value of `1rem` so will adjust the sizes of responsive font sizes used across the
  table
