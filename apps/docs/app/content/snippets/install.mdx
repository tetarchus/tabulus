## Installation

You can install `tabulus` with the following command:

```sh
npm i tabulus
```

[`react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)(v18+) and
[`react-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)(v18+) are peer dependencies (v11+), so if
they're not already installed, you'll need to install them as well:

```sh
npm i react react-dom
npm i -D @types/react @types/react-dom # If using typescript, also include the react types
```
